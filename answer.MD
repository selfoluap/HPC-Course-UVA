Compile and run a sequence of pi computations with different number of threads: from 8 threads, you should increase the number of threads in 4 for every successive simulation, until you reach 48 threads. Plot a graph to show the execution times of the computation (Y-axis) with respect to the amount of threads (X-axis). How would you explain the observed performance, considering that you have requested 32 cores from a node on Snellius?
